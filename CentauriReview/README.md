# CentauriReview

Human-owned. This is where review of AI-authored `Centauri/` PRs is specified —
first as written rubrics, later (the ambition) as bots that apply them.

The split with CI: anything in review that *can* be a mechanical check should become
a CI check, so human/automated review is reserved for the judgement calls that can't
be mechanized (is this the right abstraction? is the statement faithful to intent?).

## Status

- `rubric.md` — the initial human-review rubric (skeleton).
- Review bots — TBD.

## Already mechanized in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

- Builds against pinned Mathlib.
- `Centauri/` is free of `sorry` / `admit` / `sorryAx`.
- `Centauri/` does not import the roadmap/review trees (so it cannot inherit sorried
  goals — the real trust boundary, since the two-`lean_lib` split alone is only build
  convenience).

## Planned checks (to migrate from rubric → CI)

- **`#print axioms` allowlist audit.** Assert every `Centauri/` declaration depends
  only on an allowlist (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`). This catches
  what grep cannot: `sorryAx` reaching in through imports, `native_decide`'s
  `Lean.ofReduceBool`, and any home-rolled `axiom` — all in one gate. This is the
  most important planned upgrade.
- **Statement faithfulness.** A lockfile pinning the expected *type* of each roadmap
  milestone, with CI failing if a claimed solution's signature drifts from it — so
  "prove milestone X" can't be won by weakening the statement.
- **AI-PR path guard.** An AI-authored PR may touch only `Centauri/`.
- Docstring presence; environment linters.
