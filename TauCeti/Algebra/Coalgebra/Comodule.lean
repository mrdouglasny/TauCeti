# Comodules over a coalgebra

This file defines right comodules over an `R`-coalgebra `C` and their morphisms. A right
comodule is an `R`-module `M` equipped with a coaction `ρ : M →ₗ[R] M ⊗[R] C` satisfying
the usual coassociativity and counit identities.

This is a first Layer 1 prerequisite for the reductive-groups roadmap: representations of an
affine group scheme represented by a Hopf algebra are comodules over its coordinate Hopf
algebra, and the roadmap explicitly calls for comodules, comodule morphisms, tensor products,
duals, and the regular representation. The file starts with the core definition, the regular
right comodule of a coalgebra over itself, and the basic morphism API.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Comodule`: a right comodule over a coalgebra.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.Hom`: morphisms of comodules.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.instSelf`: the regular right comodule of a coalgebra over itself.

## References

This follows the standard definition of a right comodule over a coalgebra; see for example
Sweedler, *Hopf Algebras*, Chapter 2. It is added for the "Comodules over a coalgebra/Hopf
algebra" target in Layer 1 of the Tau Ceti reductive-groups roadmap.

/-- A right comodule over an `R`-coalgebra `C`.

The coaction is written as a linear map `coact : M →ₗ[R] M ⊗[R] C`. The coassociativity law
says that coacting twice on the `M` component agrees with coacting once and then
comultiplying the `C` component. The counit law says that applying the coalgebra counit to
the `C` component recovers the original vector, under the canonical `M ⊗ R` presentation. -/
