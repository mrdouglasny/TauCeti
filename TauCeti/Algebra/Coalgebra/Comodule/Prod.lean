# Products of comodules

For two right `C`-comodules `M` and `N` over an `R`-coalgebra `C`, this file equips the
product module `M × N` with the canonical right `C`-coaction
`(m, n) ↦ ι_M(ρ_M m) + ι_N(ρ_N n)`, where `ι_M`, `ι_N` are the inclusions into the first and
second summand. With this structure the projections `M × N → M`, `M × N → N` and the
inclusions `M → M × N`, `N → M × N` are comodule morphisms, and the universal properties of
the product and the coproduct hold, so `M × N` is simultaneously the product and the coproduct
of `M` and `N`: a direct sum of comodules.

Together with the zero object (`TauCeti.Algebra.Coalgebra.Comodule.Zero`) and the preadditive
structure (`TauCeti.Algebra.Coalgebra.Comodule.Preadditive`) this supplies the binary-biproduct
ingredient of the (finite-dimensional) comodule representation category called for in Layer 1
of the reductive-groups roadmap.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Comodule.instProd`: the right `C`-comodule structure on `M × N`.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.Hom.fst`, `TauCeti.Comodule.Hom.snd`: the projection comodule morphisms.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.Hom.inl`, `TauCeti.Comodule.Hom.inr`: the inclusion comodule morphisms.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.Hom.prod`, `TauCeti.Comodule.Hom.coprod`: the morphisms induced by the
  universal properties of the product and the coproduct, characterized by
  `fst_comp_prod`/`snd_comp_prod` and `coprod_comp_inl`/`coprod_comp_inr` together with the
  uniqueness lemmas `prod_ext`/`coprod_ext`, with the biproduct relations `fst_comp_inl`,
  `snd_comp_inl`, `fst_comp_inr`, `snd_comp_inr`.

## References

This is the standard direct sum of comodules; see for example Sweedler, *Hopf Algebras*,
Chapter 2. It supplies a binary-biproduct prerequisite for
`TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`, Layer 1, "Comodules over a coalgebra/Hopf
algebra". It reuses Mathlib's `TensorProduct.assoc` associativity coherence and the
`rTensor`/`lTensor` calculus from `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.TensorProduct.Map`.
