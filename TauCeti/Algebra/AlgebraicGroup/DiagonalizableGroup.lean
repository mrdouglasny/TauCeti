# The diagonalizable group and its character functor of points

For a commutative group `G`, the group algebra `R[G]` is a commutative Hopf algebra in which
every group element `g` is group-like (`Δ(single g 1) = single g 1 ⊗ single g 1`,
`ε(single g 1) = 1`, antipode `single g 1 ↦ single g⁻¹ 1`). The associated affine group
scheme `Spec R[G]` is the *diagonalizable group* `D(G)` of the reductive-groups roadmap.

This file records the functor-of-points calculation for `D(G)`: for every commutative
`R`-algebra `A`, the convolution group of `R`-algebra homomorphisms `R[G] →ₐ[R] A` is the
**character group** `G →* Aˣ`, with convolution corresponding to the pointwise product of
characters. A point `f` is sent to the character `g ↦ f (single g 1)` (a unit of `A` with
inverse `f (single g⁻¹ 1)`), and a character `χ` is sent to the algebra map extending it via
`MonoidAlgebra.lift`.

Specializing to `G = Multiplicative ℤ` recovers the multiplicative group `𝔾ₘ` on the
group-algebra presentation `R[Multiplicative ℤ]`: the character read from a point is its value
on the generator, and this agrees with the canonical Laurent-polynomial `𝔾ₘ` of
`TauCeti.MultiplicativeGroup` after precomposition by
`AddMonoidAlgebra.toMultiplicativeAlgEquiv`.

This is a worked-example check for the reductive-groups roadmap (Layer 4, "diagonalizable
groups and groups of multiplicative type: the anti-equivalence `M ↦ D(M) = Spec k[M]`", and
the Layer 0 target "R-points as a group"), in the same spirit as the existing multiplicative
group `𝔾ₘ`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.point`: the `R[G]`-point extending a character of `G`.
* `TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.charOfPoint`: the character of `G` read off from a point.
* `TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.pointEquiv`: algebra maps `R[G] →ₐ[R] A` are equivalent to
  characters `G →* Aˣ`.
* `TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.pointsMulEquiv`: the same equivalence as a multiplicative
  equivalence from the convolution group of points to the character group.
* `TauCeti.DiagonalizableGroup.multiplicativeGroup_pointEquiv_apply`: the bridge from the
  `G = Multiplicative ℤ` specialization to the canonical Laurent-polynomial `𝔾ₘ` API of
  `TauCeti.MultiplicativeGroup`.

## References

The Hopf algebra structure on a group algebra is Mathlib's
`Mathlib.RingTheory.HopfAlgebra.MonoidAlgebra` (with the bialgebra structure of Amelia
Livingston's monoid-algebra formalization), and `MonoidAlgebra.lift` is its universal
property. The convolution group of points and its antipode-driven inverse are Tau Ceti's
`TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.FunctorOfPoints`, built on the Mathlib convolution monoid of
Yaël Dillies, Michał Mrugała and Yunzhou Xie. This realizes the diagonalizable-group worked
example of the Tau Ceti reductive-groups roadmap (Layer 4 and Layer 0).
