# Finite product probability-measure kernels

This file provides the basic theory of the finite product of probability measures over a finite
index type, phrased directly over Mathlib's `ProbabilityMeasure.pi`: measurability of the product
kernel, and `Measure.bind`-evaluation of the mixture it induces.

Measurability:
* `measurable_probabilityMeasure_pi` — the product combinator
  `ProbabilityMeasure.pi : (Π i, ProbabilityMeasure (α i)) → ProbabilityMeasure (Π i, α i)`
  is measurable.
* `measurable_probabilityMeasure_pi_toMeasure` — the measure-valued random product
  `ω ↦ (ProbabilityMeasure.pi fun i => ν i ω).toMeasure` is measurable, for measurable coordinate
  kernels `ν i`.
* `aemeasurable_probabilityMeasure_pi_toMeasure` — the same map is `AEMeasurable` from
  a.e.-measurable coordinate kernels (`∀ i, AEMeasurable (ν i) μ`); the `_of_measurable` corollary
  is the measurable-input form.
* the constant-coordinate (`fun _ : Fin m => ν ω`) specializations
  `measurable_probabilityMeasure_pi_const_toMeasure` and
  `aemeasurable_probabilityMeasure_pi_const_toMeasure`, used by `ConditionallyIIDWith`.

Bind-evaluation of the mixture `μ.bind fun ω => (ProbabilityMeasure.pi fun i => ν i ω).toMeasure`:
* `bind_probabilityMeasure_pi_apply` — evaluation on a measurable set as the integral of the product
  kernel, from a.e.-measurable coordinate kernels.
* `bind_probabilityMeasure_pi_pi` — evaluation on a measurable rectangle as the integral of the
  product of coordinate measures, with `Fin m` constant-coordinate forms
  `bind_probabilityMeasure_pi_const_apply` and `bind_probabilityMeasure_pi_const_pi`.

This file does not introduce a new product-kernel structure; the lemmas live directly over Mathlib's
`ProbabilityMeasure.pi`. It advances `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability`, Layer 1 (product kernels,
conditional independence, mixtures), and is motivated by the product-kernel layer of
`cameronfreer/exchangeability` (`MeasureKernels.lean` and the `bind_pi_apply` of
`DeFinetti/CommonEnding.lean`, pin `e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`), implemented using
Mathlib's `ProbabilityMeasure.pi`, `Measure.bind_apply`, and Giry measurability API; the combinator
generalizes Mathlib's binary `ProbabilityMeasure.measurable_fun_prod` to finite index types.
