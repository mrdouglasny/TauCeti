# Deck transformations of a map

For a map `p : E → B`, its deck transformations are the homeomorphisms of `E` over `B`,
viewed as a subgroup of the homeomorphism group `E ≃ₜ E`. This is the first algebraic
piece needed by the universal-covers roadmap Stage 0.4: for a covering projection `p`, the
subgroup `Deck p` will be the deck transformation group.

The action of `Deck p` on the total space is inherited, by subgroup transfer, from the
tautological action of the ambient homeomorphism group `E ≃ₜ E` on `E`
(`TauCeti.Homeomorph.applyMulAction`). Each deck transformation preserves `p`, hence
preserves every fibre of `p`.

Stage 0.4, and the shape of the construction in Kim Morrison's mathlib4#40135.
