# The action of deck transformations on a fibre

A deck transformation preserves every fibre of the projection. This file packages that
restriction as a multiplicative homomorphism from the deck transformation group to the
homeomorphism group of a chosen fibre, and records the induced action on that fibre.

This is bookkeeping for the universal-covers roadmap: the later comparison between deck
transformations and the fundamental group, and the regular-cover statements, use the action of
deck transformations on individual fibres rather than only on the total space.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Deck.fiberHomeomorphHom`: the homomorphism
  `Deck p →* (p ⁻¹' {b} ≃ₜ p ⁻¹' {b})`.
* `TauCeti.Deck.instFiberMulAction`: the induced action of `Deck p` on the fibre over `b`.
* `TauCeti.Deck.mem_fiber_stabilizer_iff_coe`: membership in a fibre stabilizer is equality
  on the underlying point.

## References

This supplies a prerequisite for the Tau Ceti universal-covers roadmap, Stage 0.4
(`Deck p` as the deck transformation group), and the later deck-group action on fibres in
Stages 1 and 2.
