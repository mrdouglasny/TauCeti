# A regular covering is a quotient covering map for its deck group

For a covering map `p : E → B` with preconnected total space whose deck action is regular
(surjective, with `Deck p` acting transitively on every fibre), `p` exhibits `B` as the
quotient of `E` by the deck transformation group: `p` is a `IsQuotientCoveringMap` for
`Deck p`. This is the deck-side formulation of the universal-covers roadmap statement that
`UniversalCover x₀ / π₁(X, x₀) ≃ X`, packaged so that it consumes Mathlib's quotient
covering map theory rather than re-deriving it.

Conversely, quotient covering maps for the deck group are regular. For a preconnected
covering map, this gives an equivalence between being a quotient covering map for the deck
group and regularity of the deck action.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Deck.IsRegular.isQuotientCoveringMap`: a regular, preconnected covering map is a
  quotient covering map for its deck group.
* `TauCeti.Deck.IsQuotientCoveringMap.isRegular`: quotient covering maps for the deck group
  have regular deck action.
* `TauCeti.Deck.isQuotientCoveringMap_iff_isRegular`: for a preconnected covering map, being a
  quotient covering map for the deck group is equivalent to regularity of the deck action.
* `TauCeti.IsCoveringMap.isOpenQuotientMap`: a surjective covering map is an open quotient map.
* `TauCeti.Deck.IsRegular.isOpenQuotientMap`: a regular covering map is an open quotient map.

## References

This supplies a prerequisite for the Tau Ceti universal-covers roadmap, Stages 0.3 and 1,
where the quotient of the cover by the deck group is identified with the base via Mathlib's
`IsQuotientCoveringMap` (`Mathlib/Topology/Covering/Quotient.lean`).
