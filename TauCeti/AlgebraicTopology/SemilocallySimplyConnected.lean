# Semilocally simply connected spaces

A topological space `X` is *semilocally simply connected* if every point `x` has a
neighbourhood `U` such that every loop in `U` based at `x` is null-homotopic *in `X`*. This is
the standing point-set hypothesis (alongside path-connectedness and local path-connectedness)
under which the universal cover of a space exists; see the universal-covers roadmap. Mathlib
master has `SimplyConnectedSpace` and the local notions `LocallyContractibleSpace` and
`StronglyLocallyContractibleSpace`, but no semilocal simple connectivity; the predicate follows
Kim Morrison's unmerged mathlib4#38292 (see the References below).

The condition is genuinely *semi*local: the null-homotopy is allowed to leave `U` and use the
whole of `X`. It is therefore weaker than asking each `U` to be simply connected on its own (the
local notion); the constructor
`SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace.of_forall_exists_mem_nhds_isSimplyConnected` records that
implication. The classical local-contractibility hypothesis `LocallyContractibleSpace` is also
enough (`SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace.of_locallyContractibleSpace`), and through it every
strongly locally contractible space is semilocally simply connected. Discrete spaces are also
instances, witnessed by singleton neighbourhoods.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace`: the predicate, as a typeclass.
* `TauCeti.SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace.exists_mem_nhds_subset_loops_nullhomotopic`: the
  witnessing neighbourhood can be taken inside any prescribed neighbourhood.
* `TauCeti.SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace.exists_isOpen_mem_nhds_loops_nullhomotopic`: the
  witnessing neighbourhood can be taken open, the form the universal-cover construction consumes.
* `TauCeti.SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace.of_forall_exists_mem_nhds_isSimplyConnected`: a space
  in which every point has a simply connected neighbourhood is semilocally simply connected.
* `TauCeti.SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace.of_locallyContractibleSpace`: a locally contractible
  space is semilocally simply connected.
* Instances deriving the property for simply connected spaces, strongly locally contractible
  spaces, discrete spaces, and binary products.

## References

This file supplies the semilocal-simple-connectivity hypothesis required by the Tau Ceti
universal-covers roadmap (`TauCetiRoadmap/UniversalCovers`); see the standing hypotheses there.
The predicate follows the one Kim Morrison introduces (as `SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace`, the
classical based notion of Brazas, Definition 2.1, https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0993) in mathlib4
PRs [#31576](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/31576) and
[#38292](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/38292), which state the
universal-cover construction over `[SemilocallySimplyConnectedSpace X]`; neither has merged, so
the predicate is not yet in Mathlib. The API here is a streamlined single-field restatement
sufficient for the roadmap's Stage 0.2.
