# An almost complex structure forces even real dimension

A pointwise almost complex structure `J` on a real module `V` turns `V` into a complex vector
space (`TauCeti.AlmostComplexStructure.complexModule`), where multiplication by `i` is `J`. Since
`ℂ` is a degree-two extension of `ℝ`, the tower law forces the real dimension of `V` to be twice
its complex dimension, hence even. This is the classical fact that a manifold (or vector bundle)
admitting an almost complex structure is even-dimensional (McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves
and Symplectic Topology*, Section 2.1), recorded here at the pointwise linear-algebra level.

Everything is stated without a finite-dimensionality hypothesis: the tower law
`Module.finrank_mul_finrank` holds for `Module.finrank` unconditionally (an infinite-dimensional
`V` has `Module.finrank ℝ V = 0 = 2 * 0`), so the identities below need no `FiniteDimensional`
assumption.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.AlmostComplexStructure.complexFinrank`: the `ℂ`-dimension of `V` under the complex
  module structure induced by `J`.
* `TauCeti.AlmostComplexStructure.complexFinrank_def`: `complexFinrank` is `Module.finrank ℂ V`
  under the induced complex structure.
* `TauCeti.AlmostComplexStructure.finrank_real_eq_two_mul_complexFinrank`: the real dimension is
  twice the complex dimension, `finrank ℝ V = 2 * J.complexFinrank`.
* `TauCeti.AlmostComplexStructure.even_finrank_real`: the real dimension of a module carrying an
  almost complex structure is even.
* `TauCeti.AlmostComplexStructure.isEmpty_of_odd_finrank`: an odd-dimensional real module admits no
  almost complex structure.

The conventions follow McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*,
Section 2.1.
