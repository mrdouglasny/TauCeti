# Lagrangian subspaces of a tame pair are maximal totally real

The analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap keeps *totally real* and *Lagrangian* as separate named
hypotheses (a totally real subspace `L` is one complementary to its `J`-image, `V = L ⊕ JL`; a
Lagrangian subspace is one equal to its symplectic complement, `L^ω = L`), because the two play
different roles downstream: totally real boundary conditions for the Cauchy--Riemann operator and
the tori `T_α`, `T_β` in `Sym^g(Σ)` (Lane F4), Lagrangian boundary conditions for exact Lagrangian
Floer homology (Lane F3). They are nevertheless tightly linked: on a finite-dimensional space, as
soon as a symplectic form `ω` *tames* an almost complex structure `J`, every Lagrangian subspace
is automatically maximal totally real. This file records that link in general, complementing the
standard-model statement in `Lagrangian.lean` where the coordinate factors of `V × V` are seen to
be simultaneously Lagrangian and maximal totally real.

The mechanism is the one classical computation behind "a compatible `J` makes a Lagrangian totally
real" (McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Section 2.6), split here
into its two genuinely separate pieces, following the roadmap's instruction to keep tame and
compatible distinct:

* **Disjointness** `L ⊓ JL = ⊥` needs only *taming*, not invariance: if `x = J y` lies in an
  isotropic `L` with `y ∈ L`, then `ω(y, J y) = ω(y, x) = 0` by isotropy, so `y = 0` by taming,
  hence `x = 0`. No finite-dimensionality is used.
* **Spanning** `L ⊔ JL = ⊤` is the half-dimension count: `J` is a linear isomorphism so
  `dim JL = dim L`, and a Lagrangian subspace is half-dimensional, so `dim L + dim JL = dim V`.

On a finite-dimensional space, taming alone therefore upgrades a Lagrangian subspace to a maximal
totally real one.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.SymplecticForm.IsIsotropic.disjoint_map_of_tames`: an isotropic subspace of a taming
  pair is disjoint from its `J`-image.
* `TauCeti.SymplecticForm.IsLagrangian.isMaximalTotallyReal_of_tames`: a Lagrangian subspace of a
  taming pair on a finite-dimensional space is maximal totally real, i.e. `V = L ⊕ JL`.
* `TauCeti.SymplecticForm.IsLagrangian.isMaximalTotallyReal_of_compatible`: the same for a
  compatible pair.
* `TauCeti.SymplecticForm.IsLagrangian.existsUnique_add_of_tames`: the resulting unique
  decomposition `x = (x ∈ L) + (x ∈ JL)`.

The conventions follow McDuff--Salamon, *J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*,
Sections 2.3 and 2.6.
