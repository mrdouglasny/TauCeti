# Totally real factors of the standard product almost complex structure

The general doubled-module lemmas in `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.TotallyReal` are phrased for the
Mathlib map `LinearEquiv.skewSwap`, which sends `(x, y)` to `(-y, x)`. The symplectic layer has
its own bundled version of the same map, `TauCeti.AlmostComplexStructure.product`. This file
bridges the two so the geometric standard structure reuses the algebraic results rather than
restating them.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.AlmostComplexStructure.product_toLinearMap_eq_skewSwap`: the standard product almost
  complex structure is the `skewSwap` doubled-module complex structure.
* `TauCeti.Submodule.isMaximalTotallyReal_prod_top_bot_product` and
  `TauCeti.Submodule.isMaximalTotallyReal_prod_bot_top_product`: the two coordinate factors of
  `V × V` are maximal totally real for the standard product almost complex structure.
