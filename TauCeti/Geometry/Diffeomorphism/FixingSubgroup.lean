# Diffeomorphisms fixing a subset pointwise

The geometric-topology roadmap's relative diffeomorphism groups, such as `Diff(M, ∂M)`, are
subgroups of the self-diffeomorphism group whose elements fix a specified subset pointwise. Mathlib
already provides the generic pointwise fixing subgroup `fixingSubgroup` for any group
action; this file specializes that construction to the tautological action of the diffeomorphism
group on its manifold.

This is the algebraic substrate for the layer-3 target in
`TauCetiRoadmap/GeometricTopology/README.md`, "diffeomorphism groups with the C^∞ topology", where
`Diff(M, ∂M)` is the subgroup fixing the boundary pointwise. The topology and the proof that the
relative subgroup is closed are deliberately left to the later `C^∞`-topology buildout.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Diffeomorph.fixingSubgroup s`: self-diffeomorphisms fixing every point of `s`.
* `TauCeti.RelativeDiff I M n s`: the corresponding relative diffeomorphism group,
  as a type abbreviation for that subgroup.

## Main results

* `mem_fixingSubgroup_iff`: membership is the pointwise equation `∀ x ∈ s, f x = x`.
* `fixingSubgroup_empty` / `fixingSubgroup_univ`: the empty-set fixer is all of `Diff(M)`, and
  the whole-space fixer is trivial.
* `fixingSubgroup_antitone`: fixing a larger set gives a smaller subgroup.
* `fixingSubgroup_le_stabilizer`: pointwise fixing a subset implies stabilizing it setwise.
* `toHomeomorph_mem_fixingSubgroup`: forgetting smoothness sends a relative diffeomorphism to the
  corresponding relative homeomorphism.
