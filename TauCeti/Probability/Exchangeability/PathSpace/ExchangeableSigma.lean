# Exchangeable σ-algebra on path space

This file records the Layer 2 exchangeability-roadmap σ-algebra of path-space events invariant
under finitely supported permutations of the time coordinate.  It also relates the one-sided path
tail σ-algebra to this exchangeable σ-algebra: a tail event is fixed by every finitely supported
time permutation.
