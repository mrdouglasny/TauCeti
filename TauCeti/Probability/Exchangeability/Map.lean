# Coordinatewise maps of exchangeable processes

This file records that the Layer 0 symmetry notions for sequence laws are preserved by
applying a measurable map to every coordinate of the process. It supplies the process-level
closure API promised by the Exchangeability roadmap from the law-level lemmas
`map_blockLaw`, `map_prefixLaw`, and `map_pathLaw` in `Basic.lean`.

These statements follow `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 0, the item
asking for closure of the symmetry classes under coordinatewise pushforward. The proofs use
only Tau Ceti's existing finite-dimensional law API and Mathlib's `Measure.map`
composition lemmas.
