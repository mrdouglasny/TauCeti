# Pullbacks of positive-definite functions

This file adds the pullback API for `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite`, the positive-definite
function predicate on an involutive additive monoid. A star-preserving additive homomorphism
`φ : N → M` pulls a positive-definite function `F : M → ℂ` back to the positive-definite
function `F ∘ φ : N → ℂ`; if `φ` is surjective, positive-definiteness can also be descended
from the pullback.

This is part of the `OneParameterSemigroups` roadmap, Part C, whose positive-definite-function
API asks for pullbacks alongside the PD-function/PD-kernel correspondence and the closure
properties. The proofs are the finite-family reindexing argument: apply the defining
nonnegativity of `F` to the image family under `φ`, using preservation of addition and star to
identify the Gram entries.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.comp`: positive-definiteness is preserved by precomposition with
  any star-preserving additive homomorphism, stated using Mathlib's homomorphism classes.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.comp_addMonoidHom`: the same statement for an explicit
  `AddMonoidHom` plus a star-preservation hypothesis.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.of_comp_surjective` and
  `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.comp_iff_of_surjective`: descent and equivalence for surjective
  star-preserving additive homomorphisms.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.comp_addEquiv_iff`: invariance under a star-preserving additive
  equivalence.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.comp_fst`, `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.comp_snd`, and
  `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.mul_comp_fst_snd`: the projection pullbacks and their pointwise
  product on a product monoid.
