# Existence and uniqueness form of Lax--Milgram

Mathlib's Lax--Milgram theorem is packaged as
`IsCoercive.continuousLinearEquivOfBilin`: a coercive continuous bilinear form
`B : V →L[ℝ] V →L[ℝ] ℝ` induces a continuous linear equivalence `V ≃L[ℝ] V` sending
`u` to the Riesz representative of the functional `v ↦ B u v`.

The PDE roadmap's energy-method lane needs the corresponding variational-solution API:
given a represented forcing functional `v ↦ ⟪F, v⟫`, there is a unique `u` satisfying
`B u v = ⟪F, v⟫` for every test vector `v`.  This file records that direct
existence/uniqueness form without changing Mathlib's theorem or introducing any PDE-specific
bundled structure.

## Main declarations

* `IsCoercive.solutionOfInner`: the solution of the variational equation with forcing
  represented by `F`.
* `IsCoercive.apply_solutionOfInner_eq_inner`: the defining variational identity.
* `IsCoercive.eq_solutionOfInner`: uniqueness of a vector satisfying the variational
  identity.
* `IsCoercive.existsUnique_forall_eq_inner`: the combined existence-and-uniqueness theorem.
* `IsCoercive.solutionOfFunctional` and `IsCoercive.existsUnique_forall_eq`: the same API
  for an arbitrary continuous linear functional, using Fréchet--Riesz representation.

The proof is a thin wrapper around Mathlib's `IsCoercive.continuousLinearEquivOfBilin` and
its characteristic identity.
