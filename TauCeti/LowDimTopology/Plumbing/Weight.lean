# The characteristic weight function of a plumbing lattice

This file adds the integer-valued quadratic weight attached to a characteristic covector on the
integral lattice of a plumbing graph. For a characteristic covector `k` and a lattice point
`x : V → ℤ`, the numerator

`∑ v, k v * x v + P.intersectionForm x x`

is even, so the lattice-homology weight

`-(∑ v, k v * x v + P.intersectionForm x x) / 2`

is an integer. This is the local `χ_k(x)` function used in the lattice-homology lane before the
cube weights and `ℤ[U]` complexes are introduced.

The numerator is defined for arbitrary covectors, while the weight itself is restricted to
characteristic covectors so that the division by `2` has the expected integer meaning.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.characteristicWeightNumerator`: the even numerator
  `⟨k, x⟩ + x · x`.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.characteristicWeight`: the integer weight `χ_k(x)` for characteristic
  covectors.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.even_characteristicWeightNumerator`: characteristicness makes the
  numerator even.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.two_mul_characteristicWeight`: the defining equation
  `2 * χ_k(x) = - (⟨k, x⟩ + x · x)`.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.characteristicWeight_add_two_mul`: shifting a covector by `2l`
  subtracts `⟨l, x⟩` from the weight.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.characteristicWeight_canonical_single`: the canonical characteristic
  covector gives weight `1` on each basis sphere.
