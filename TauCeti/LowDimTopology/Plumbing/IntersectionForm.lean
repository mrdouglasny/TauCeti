# Plumbing graphs and their intersection forms

This file opens the lattice-homology lane of the combinatorial Heegaard Floer roadmap. A
plumbing graph records the combinatorial data of a plumbing of disk bundles over spheres: a
simple graph whose vertices are the spheres, whose edges record which spheres are plumbed, and
an integer weight on each vertex giving its self-intersection (the framing / Euler number).

The fundamental algebraic object attached to this data is the **intersection form**, the
symmetric `ℤ`-bilinear form on `V → ℤ` whose matrix is the framing on the diagonal and the
adjacency indicator off the diagonal. This is the lattice on which Némethi's lattice homology
of a (negative-definite) plumbed three-manifold is built. Here we set up the matrix, its
entry formulas and symmetry, the bilinear form and its self-pairing expansion as a quadratic
form, and the negative-definiteness predicate, recording that a negative-definite plumbing has
every framing negative.

We model the underlying combinatorics with a `SimpleGraph`: one edge between two distinct
spheres, no edge multiplicities or signs. The matrix-level definitions make sense for any
vertex type; the lattice form used for Lane L is introduced under `[Fintype V]`, matching the
finite plumbing graphs in the roadmap. This is the standard starting point (the plumbing trees
of Seifert-fibred examples), with edge multiplicities a later refinement.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph`: a simple graph with an integer weight on each vertex.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.intersectionMatrix`: the framing-diagonal adjacency matrix.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.intersectionForm`: the associated symmetric `ℤ`-bilinear form.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite`: negative-definiteness of the intersection matrix.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.intersectionMatrix_diag` and
  `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.intersectionMatrix_apply_of_ne`: the diagonal entry is the framing and
  an off-diagonal entry is the adjacency indicator.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.intersectionMatrix_isSymm`,
  `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.intersectionForm_isSymm`: the intersection form is symmetric.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.intersectionForm_apply_weight_add_adj`: the bilinear form expanded
  as framing terms plus adjacency terms.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.intersectionForm_self`: the self-pairing as a quadratic form, the
  framing-weighted sum of squares plus the adjacency cross terms.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.weight_neg`: a negative-definite plumbing has every
  framing negative.

/-- A plumbing graph: a simple graph together with an integer weight on each vertex.

The vertices are the plumbed spheres, the edges record which pairs of spheres are plumbed
together, and `weight v` is the self-intersection number (the framing / Euler number) of the
sphere `v`. The combinatorics is modelled by a `SimpleGraph`: at most one edge between two
distinct vertices, and no self-loops. The finite lattice API is provided by declarations that
assume `[Fintype V]`. -/
