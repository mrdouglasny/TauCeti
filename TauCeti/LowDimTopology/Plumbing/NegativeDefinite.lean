# Negative-definiteness of the plumbing intersection form

This file records what the negative-definiteness hypothesis buys at the level of the integral
intersection form, rather than only at the level of its matrix. Lattice homology is built on a
*negative-definite* plumbing, and the property used throughout the theory is that the form is
strictly negative on every nonzero lattice vector, which in particular implies that it is
nondegenerate, so the plumbing lattice carries no isotropic directions and the lattice points it
indexes are separated by the form.

The matrix-level definition `PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite` says that the negated intersection
matrix is positive definite, i.e. `0 < xᵀ (-A) x` for every nonzero integer vector `x`. Here we
transport that statement through `Matrix.toBilin'` to the bilinear form
`PlumbingGraph.intersectionForm`, obtaining the self-pairing sign, the resulting vanishing
criterion, nondegeneracy, and the injectivity of multiplication by the intersection matrix. As a
self-validating example the `A₂` plumbing (two `-2`-framed spheres joined by an edge) is shown to
be negative definite.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.intersectionForm_self_neg`: the intersection form is
  strictly negative on every nonzero lattice vector.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.intersectionForm_self_nonpos`: the self-pairing is
  always nonpositive.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.intersectionForm_self_eq_zero_iff`: the self-pairing
  vanishes exactly at the origin.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.intersectionForm_nondegenerate`: the form is
  nondegenerate.
* `TauCeti.PlumbingGraph.IsNegativeDefinite.mulVec_injective`: multiplication by the intersection
  matrix is injective, so the lattice embeds along the form.
* `TauCeti.a2Plumbing_isNegativeDefinite`: the `A₂` plumbing is negative definite.

("lattice homology"), whose standing hypothesis is a negative-definite plumbing: Némethi's
lattice homology `ℍ⁻`/`ℍ⁰` and its weight functions are defined on, and finite because of, the
negative-definite intersection lattice. See Némethi,
