# A concrete rank-two lattice exercising the geometry-of-numbers engine

The Layer-0 engine in `TauCeti/NumberTheory/GeometryOfNumbers/Doubling.lean` proves its
packing and doubling bounds for an *arbitrary* additive subgroup `Λ ≤ (ι → ℂ)`. This file
is the roadmap's acceptance-criterion worked example for that engine: a concrete rank-two
lattice in the plane `ℂ ≅ ℝ²` (indexed by `ι = Fin 1`, so `Fin 1 → ℂ` is one copy of `ℂ`)
on which both bounds become explicit numbers.

The lattice is the Gaussian lattice `ℤ + ℤ·i`, packaged as
`TauCeti.GeometryOfNumbers.gaussianLattice : AddSubgroup (Fin 1 → ℂ)`. Its only nontrivial
input to the engine is the separation hypothesis: a *nonzero* Gaussian integer has norm at
least `1` (`one_le_norm_of_mem_gaussianLattice_of_ne_zero`), so the packing lemma applies
with separation scale `ρ = 1/2` and produces a finite intersection with the box.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GeometryOfNumbers.one_le_norm_of_mem_gaussianLattice_of_ne_zero`: a nonzero
  point of the Gaussian lattice has norm at least `1` (the lattice's minimal distance).
* `TauCeti.GeometryOfNumbers.gaussianLattice_inter_box_two_finite`: the lattice points in
  the radius-two box form a finite set (the packing lemma discharges discreteness).
* `TauCeti.GeometryOfNumbers.gaussianLattice_inter_box_two_ncard_le`: at most `256` of
  them, the explicit packing count `(8/ρ)^(2·#ι)` at `ρ = 1/2`, `#ι = 1`.
* `gaussianLattice_ncard_inter_box_two_le_sixtyFour_mul_ncard_inter_box_one`:
  the doubling instance `#(Λ ∩ box 2) ≤ 64 · #(Λ ∩ box 1)`, the engine's factor
  `64^{#ι}` at `#ι = 1`.

These exercise both halves of the engine — `addSubgroup_inter_box_finite_and_ncard_le_of_separated`
and `ncard_inter_box_two_le_pow_mul_ncard_inter_box_one` — on a genuine rank-two lattice,
with no new analytic input beyond the elementary minimal-distance bound.
