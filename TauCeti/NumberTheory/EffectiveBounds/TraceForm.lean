# Trace-form diagonalisation for square-root bases

The effective discriminant bound `|d_K| ≤ |disc b|` (already in
`TauCeti/NumberTheory/EffectiveBounds/Discriminant.lean`) is only useful once one can
*evaluate* `disc b` on a concrete basis. The cheapest bases of a quadratic field are the
square-root bases `{1, x}` with `x² ∈ K`, and on those the trace form is diagonal when
`x ∉ K`: the off-diagonal entry `Tr(1 · x) = Tr x` vanishes because a non-base-field
element whose square lies in the base field has trace zero.

This file records the EffectiveBounds square-root examples using the reusable trace and
discriminant API from `TauCeti.FieldTheory.Trace`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.NumberField.trace_eq_zero_of_sq_ratCast_of_not_mem_range`: the number-field
  specialization, for `x` in a number field `K` with `x² ∈ ℚ` and `x ∉ ℚ`.
* `TauCeti.Algebra.discr_one_self_eq_of_sq`: for a quadratic extension `L / K` and
  `x ∉ K` with `x² = a ∈ K`, the trace-form discriminant of the basis `{1, x}` is `4 a`.

The two `example`s at the end exercise the API on `ℂ / ℝ` (degree two): `Tr_{ℂ/ℝ} I = 0`
and `disc ℝ {1, I} = -4`, mirroring the roadmap's `ℚ(i)` worked example.

## Provenance

The trace-vanishing criterion migrates `trace_eq_zero_of_sq_ratCast` from
[kim-em/erdos-unit-distance](https://github.com/kim-em/erdos-unit-distance), the
formalization of L. Alpöge's disproof of the uniform-constant Erdős unit-distance
conjecture, where it diagonalises the trace form on square-root bases. The reusable
criterion and discriminant formula live in `TauCeti.FieldTheory.Trace`; this file keeps
the EffectiveBounds worked examples near the roadmap target.
