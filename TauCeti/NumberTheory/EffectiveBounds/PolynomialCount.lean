# Counting integer polynomials of bounded degree and height

For natural numbers `D` and `C`, the set of integer polynomials of degree at most `D` whose
coefficients are all bounded in absolute value by `C` is finite, with at most

`(2·C + 1)^(D + 1)`

elements. Indeed such a polynomial is determined by its `D + 1` coefficients of index `0, …, D`
(every higher coefficient vanishes), each of which lies in the integer interval `[-C, C]` of
size `2·C + 1`; counting the coefficient vectors gives the bound.

This is the elementary counting step that the **Layer 2** summit of the effective-bounds
roadmap needs. Mathlib's qualitative Hermite–Minkowski theorem
(`NumberField.finite_of_discr_bdd`) already bounds the degree and the coefficients of a
generating polynomial of each number field of bounded discriminant, but it only concludes
*finiteness* of the resulting polynomial family (through `Polynomial.bUnion_roots_finite` over a
finite coefficient box); it never counts it. The existing explicit count
`TauCeti.Polynomial.ncard_natDegree_le_abs_intCoeff_le` is what turns that finiteness into an
explicit upper bound on the number of fields.

## Main results

The explicit count is `TauCeti.Polynomial.ncard_natDegree_le_abs_intCoeff_le`.

* `TauCeti.NumberField.intPolynomialBox`: the polynomial box in the effective-bounds namespace.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.finite_intPolynomial_degree_height`: the same family is finite.
