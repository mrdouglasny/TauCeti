# The grid `J`-function

This file adds the finite point-pair count used in the Maslov and Alexander gradings of grid
homology. For finite sets of grid points, `GridPoint.I s t` counts ordered pairs
`(p, q) ∈ s × t` with `p` strictly southwest of `q`, and `GridPoint.J s t` is the symmetrized
half-count.

The API is deliberately point-set level: later grading definitions apply it to grid-state and
marking point sets, and then extend it to the formal differences appearing in `M_O`, `M_X`,
and `A`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridPoint.IsSouthWest`: the strict southwest relation on grid squares.
* `TauCeti.GridPoint.I`: the ordered southwest pair count.
* `TauCeti.GridPoint.JNum`: the numerator of the symmetrized `J`-function.
* `TauCeti.GridPoint.J`: the rational-valued symmetrized `J`-function.
* `TauCeti.GridState.J`, `TauCeti.GridDiagram.JO`, and `TauCeti.GridDiagram.JX`: specialized
  forms for grid states and markings.

## References

This supplies a prerequisite for `HeegaardFloer/README.md` in TauCetiRoadmap, Lane G.2,
"Gradings. The `J`-function, `M_O`, `M_X`, `A`; integer-valuedness of `A`; grading-change
formulas across a rectangle." The definition follows Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology
for Knots and Links*, Chapter 3.2, where `J` is the symmetrization of the northeast/southwest
point-pair count.
