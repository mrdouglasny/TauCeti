# Symmetries of the fully blocked grid differential

The grid-combinatorial lane already records how the diagonal reflection and the `O`/`X` marking
swap of a grid diagram act on the Maslov and Alexander gradings (`Gradings.lean`,
`GradingInteger.lean`): the diagonal reflection leaves both gradings unchanged, while the marking
swap exchanges the two Maslov gradings `M_O` and `M_X` and sends the Alexander grading to its
negative up to a shift. This file proves the matching statements one level up, on the chain
complex itself.

The rectangle-level groundwork lives earlier: `Rectangle.lean` shows that the diagonal
reflection `GridRectangleBetween.transpose` preserves emptiness and marking avoidance, and
`BlockedRectangle.lean` turns this into the rectangle-count symmetries
`fullyBlockedRectangleCount_transpose` and `fullyBlockedRectangleCount_swapMarkings`. Here we lift
those matrix coefficients to the differential itself: the marking swap fixes the whole
differential, while the diagonal reflection intertwines the differentials of `G` and `G.transpose`
through the chain relabeling `GridChain.transposeEquiv` (defined in `Complex.lean`) induced by
`GridState.transpose`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_swapMarkings`: the whole differential is unchanged
  by swapping the `O` and `X` markings.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_transpose`: the differential commutes with the
  transpose chain relabeling, intertwining the differentials of `G` and `G.transpose`; this is the
  chain symmetry of the diagonal reflection.

## References

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md`, Lane G item 8
("Symmetries and the genus bound"), together with that roadmap's standing convention to "state
invariance naturality-ready": these are the chain-level symmetries of the fully blocked grid
complex on which an invariance statement is later built. The diagonal and marking symmetries
follow Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots and Links*, Chapter 3.
