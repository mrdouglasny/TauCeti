# A grid rectangle move is a column transposition

An oriented rectangle `R : GridRectangleBetween x y` records the two side columns at which the
target state `y` differs from the source state `x`: at the initial side column `y` reads the
row `x` uses at the terminal side, and vice versa, while the two states agree away from the two
side columns. That is exactly the effect of swapping the two side columns of `x`, so the target
state is the column transposition `x.swapColumns R.left R.right`.

This file makes that identification precise and draws the point-set consequences: the two
states share all but two of their occupied squares, and each occupied square they do not share
is one of the four corners of the rectangle. The shared squares are exactly the intersection of
the two point sets, which has `n - 2` elements. These are the bookkeeping facts a Maslov or
Alexander grading-change computation across a rectangle rests on, and they let later
`∂² = 0`-style arguments reason about `x` and `y` through a single transposition.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.target_eq_swapColumns`: the target state of a rectangle is the
  source state with the two side columns swapped.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.source_eq_swapColumns`: the symmetric statement recovering the
  source from the target.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.mem_pointSet_inter_iff`: a square is shared by the two states
  exactly when it belongs to the source and avoids the two side columns -- the rectangle
  specialization of `GridState.mem_pointSet_inter_swapColumns_iff` from `Diagram.lean`.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.source_pointSet_eq`,
  `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.target_pointSet_eq`: each state's point set is the shared part
  together with its own two corners.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.card_pointSet_inter`: the two states share exactly `n - 2`
  squares.
