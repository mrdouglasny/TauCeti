# Support of the fully blocked grid differential

A grid rectangle from `x` to `y` exists only when the two states differ at exactly two columns,
where they exchange their rows: `RectangleSwap.lean` records that the target of any oriented
rectangle is `y = x.swapColumns R.left R.right` for the two distinct side columns. Reading this
backwards bounds the *support* of the fully blocked grid differential: the coefficient of `y` in
`∂ x` can only be nonzero when `y` is one of the finitely many column transpositions of `x`.

This is the structural fact that makes the fully blocked complex computable. Although there are
`n!` grid states, the differential of a generator only ever reaches the `O(n²)` states obtained
by swapping a pair of columns, so an evaluation of `∂` never has to range over all of `GridState
n`. It is also a step the rectangle-pairing `∂² = 0` argument relies on: a length-two sequence of
rectangles `x → y → z` passes through a column transposition `y` of `x`, not an arbitrary state.

## Key API

* `TauCeti.GridState.columnSwapNeighbors`: the grid states obtained from `x` by transposing a
  pair of distinct columns -- the states a rectangle from `x` can reach.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.exists_swapColumns_of_fullyBlockedRectangleCount_ne_zero`: a nonzero
  differential coefficient forces the target to be a column transposition of the source.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangleCount_eq_zero_of_forall_ne`: the coefficient vanishes
  whenever the target is not any column transposition of the source.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferentialOnGenerator_support_subset` and
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedDifferential_single_support_subset`: the differential of a
  generator is supported on the column-swap neighbours of the state.
