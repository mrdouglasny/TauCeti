# Fully blocked empty rectangles in grid diagrams

This file packages the finite rectangle counts used by the fully blocked grid differential.
For grid states `x` and `y`, the already-defined `GridRectangleBetween x y` records an
oriented toroidal rectangle from `x` to `y`. Here we filter the generic empty-rectangle
enumeration to rectangles whose interiors avoid all `O` and `X` markings of a grid diagram.

The final count is valued in `ZMod 2`, matching the first coefficient system used in the grid
homology roadmap.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangles`: empty rectangles avoiding all markings.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangleCount`: the corresponding count in `ZMod 2`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangleCount_transpose`: the count is invariant under the
  diagonal reflection of a grid diagram and its two states.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangles_swapMarkings` and
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedRectangleCount_swapMarkings`: the rectangle set and its count
  are unchanged by swapping the `O` and `X` markings.

where the fully blocked grid complex over `𝔽₂` counts rectangles avoiding all markings. The

"Fully blocked" means that the rectangle is empty for the source grid state and its interior
avoids every `O` and `X` marking. This is the rectangle set whose parity gives the coefficient
of `y` in the fully blocked grid differential applied to `x`. -/
