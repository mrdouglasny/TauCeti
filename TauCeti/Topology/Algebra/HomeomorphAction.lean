# The tautological action of the homeomorphism group

For a topological space `E`, the homeomorphism group `E ≃ₜ E` acts on `E` by evaluation:
`φ • e = φ e`. This file records that action, that it is faithful, and that it is continuous
in the point, mirroring `Equiv.Perm.applyMulAction` and the construction in Kim Morrison's
mathlib4#40135.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Homeomorph.applyMulAction`: the `MulAction (E ≃ₜ E) E` with `φ • e = φ e`.
* `TauCeti.Homeomorph.smul_def`: the defining simp lemma `φ • e = φ e`.
* `TauCeti.Homeomorph.applyFaithfulSMul`: the action is faithful.
* `TauCeti.Homeomorph.applyContinuousConstSMul`: each homeomorphism acts continuously.
