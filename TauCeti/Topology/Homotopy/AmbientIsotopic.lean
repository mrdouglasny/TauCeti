# The ambient-isotopy equivalence relation

Building on `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy` (an ambient isotopy of a space `Y`: a homotopy from the
identity whose level-preserving total map `I × Y → I × Y` is a homeomorphism), this file makes
ambient isotopy a relation between maps and shows it is an equivalence relation. Two maps
`f g : C(X, Y)` are **ambient isotopic** when some ambient isotopy `Φ` of `Y` carries `f` to `g`,
meaning its final homeomorphism postcomposes `f` to `g`. This is the continuous topological
relation the geometric-topology roadmap (`TauCetiRoadmap/GeometricTopology`, encoding conventions)
intends to specialise to smooth embeddings `S¹ ↪ M` to underlie knot equivalence: "isotopy is
defined generally, then specialised".

The reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of the relation are powered by three closure
operations on ambient isotopies themselves, which live beside the `AmbientIsotopy` structure in
`TauCeti.Topology.Homotopy.Isotopy`: the constant ambient isotopy `AmbientIsotopy.refl`, the
pointwise composition `AmbientIsotopy.trans`, and the pointwise inverse `AmbientIsotopy.symm`.
Because each of their total maps is a composition or inverse of homeomorphisms, none of the
closure operations needs the closed-cover gluing that `Isotopy.trans` requires; the definitions
follow Burde--Zieschang, *Knots*, Chapter 1, where ambient isotopy of `Sⁿ` is exactly this
relation.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopic f g`: the proposition that some ambient isotopy of `Y` carries `f` to
  `g`.
* `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopic.setoid`: the equivalence relation packaged as a `Setoid`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopic.refl` / `symm` / `trans` and `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopic.equivalence`:
  ambient isotopy is an equivalence relation on `C(X, Y)`.
* `TauCeti.AmbientIsotopic.isotopic`: ambient isotopic embeddings are isotopic, specialising the
  ambient relation to the general isotopy relation of `Isotopy.lean`.

/-- Two maps `f g : C(X, Y)` are **ambient isotopic** if some ambient isotopy of the codomain `Y`
carries `f` to `g`, that is, its final homeomorphism postcomposes `f` to `g`. This is the
continuous topological ambient-isotopy relation intended to underlie later knot-equivalence
specialisations (ambient isotopy of smooth embeddings `S¹ ↪ M`); it does not itself encode the
