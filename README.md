# Tau Ceti

Let's do lots of maths.

Humans own the roadmap for this repository, which is written mostly in markdown and a small amount of Lean. Changes to the roadmap are made via human-reviewed pull requests.

AIs own the code, initiating pull requests and shepherding these pull requests through an AI-driven review process.

Humans can raise issues against the code, and leave implementation (and review) to AIs.

## Division of labour

| Path | Owner | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TauCeti/` | **AIs** | All the Lean mathematics. |
| `TauCetiRoadmap/` | **humans** | Roadmaps in markdown, and sample Lean files where `sorry` is allowed. |
| `TauCetiReview/` | **humans** | Review rubrics and (eventually) review bots. |
| `.github/`, `lakefile.toml`, `lean-toolchain`, `lake-manifest.json` | **humans** | The rules of the game and the machinery that enforces them. |

This division is managed via the `CODEOWNERS` file and branch protection rules.
The `main` branch is always green: it contains no `sorry`, and no axioms beyond the standard `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`; in particular, no `native_decide`. This is enforced in CI by an axiom audit (`lake exe axioms`; see `TauCetiReview/`).

## Review

This part is still very much an open question, which I'd like input on.

My current idea is that all PRs will be reviewed by AIs running according to a fixed open source rubric (prompt, spec, language model program, whatever you want to call it). The humans involved in this project will write that rubric, and evolve it over time as we see the need.

When a PR is opened, we will automatically launch some combination of frontier models, prompted to review the PR according to the rubric. As replies and further commits are added, we'll feed these back to the same models (possibly even resuming the conversation) for further feedback. The review agents can approve PRs, and PRs automatically merge once approved.

The rubric will be **adversarial**, including instructions to find mis-formalizations, vacuous statements, and "pushing around the lump in the carpet". We'll name specific antipatterns to look for. We'll likely need to avoid letting a frontier model review itself.

I suspect there should be multiple rubrics covering different aspects of review, and merging requires approval from everyone (or perhaps a soft cutoff for more subjective aspects of review).

These review agents' token costs will be covered by some combination of philanthropic donations (in money or in kind), and perhaps eventually on a "billable hours" basis for significant contributors. That is, industrial or academic groups making significant pull requests should expect to donate tokens sufficient to power the review bots in proportion to their contributions. Likely small scale contributions can be reviewed "for free" out of this pool.

## Mathlib dependency

For now we depend on Mathlib's `master` branch. AIs are encouraged to make PRs that bump the pin to new commits on the `master` branch, and fix any resulting problems in the library.

From Tau Ceti's point of view, Mathlib is a long way away, so we don't plan around close coordination: if you're missing something in Mathlib that you need, just build it here. (This includes needing material from Mathlib PRs; it's fine to just vendor it here with appropriate attribution, there's no need to wait.)

Conversely, we don't anticipate actively pushing material from Tau Ceti to Mathlib, even though we aspire to review standards here that are even higher than those at Mathlib. Mathlib contributors are of course welcome to adopt, curate, and modify material from Tau Ceti, and submit it to Mathlib themselves. Everything here is Apache licensed.

## Building

```bash
lake exe cache get   # fetch prebuilt Mathlib oleans
lake build
```
