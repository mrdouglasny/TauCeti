# check-bump.sh — validate that a PR's proposed Lake-pin / toolchain change is a
# safe, machine-checkable *forward* bump, and nothing else.
#
# This is the trust anchor that lets a PR touching `lake-manifest.json` and/or
# `lean-toolchain` (but NOT the lakefile) be built and auto-merged without a human:
# the worry is a PR that re-points a dependency at a malicious fork/commit or a
# malicious toolchain and then gets auto-built. We reduce the whole manifest to a
# deterministic function of one validated fact — "mathlib moved forward on the
# branch nominated in lakefile.toml" — and require the toolchain to move forward
# and match mathlib's:
#
#   1. lakefile.toml / lakefile.lean are byte-identical to base (lakefile edits
#      stay human-owned; they change which branch/dep is even nominated).
#   2. The nominated require (mathlib) is the ONLY package named "mathlib", is a
#      `git` package pinned to a 40-hex commit SHA, keeps its url + inputRev
#      (master), and its new rev is a *descendant of the old rev* AND *on
#      inputRev's history* — a genuine forward move on the nominated branch (via
#      the GitHub compare API; the SHA requirement makes the compared revs
#      immutable, so what we validate is exactly what Lake will resolve and build).
#   3. The PR manifest's package set, MINUS mathlib, is EXACTLY mathlib's own
#      lake-manifest at the new rev, field-for-field (type/url/rev/inputRev) — no
#      package added, removed, renamed, retyped (e.g. a `path` dep), duplicated, or
#      re-pointed independently of the trusted mathlib.
#   4. lean-toolchain moves monotonically forward on the leanprover/lean4 channel
#      AND equals mathlib's lean-toolchain at the new rev.
#
# It does NO build and runs NONE of the PR's code — only reads/parses two text
# files and queries the trusted upstream via `gh api`. Usage:
#
#   check-bump.sh <base_dir> <merge_base_dir> <pr_dir>
#
# where each dir holds the repo's lean-toolchain, lake-manifest.json, lakefile.toml
# (and optionally lakefile.lean). base_dir is the CURRENT target-branch tip — the
# trusted config the PR actually builds and merges against, and what a genuine bump is
# validated against. merge_base_dir is the PR's merge-base with the target branch, used
# only to decide whether the PR changed these files at all (so a PR that is merely
# behind the tip is not judged as if it had edited them). Exit 0 = safe forward bump
# (or no pin change); exit 1 = not auto-mergeable (route to a human). Reasons printed.
