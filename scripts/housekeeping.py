"""Queue housekeeping: retire PRs that are spent or stuck, and close duplicate roadmap PRs.

Green PRs merge on their own (the merge queue, fed by auto-merge.yml). This covers the janitorial
jobs, in CI so the autonomous worker can stay focused on producing work, and so that EVERY PR ends up
either merged or closed — never stranded:

  empty    Close a roadmap PR (one carrying the `<!--tauceti-target:v1 ...-->` marker) whose diff
           against main is empty — its changes already landed in main, typically because a sibling
           worker attempt at the same target merged first. dedup only matches an OPEN twin, so once the
           twin merges this is what reaps the loser, instead of leaving it for the 7-day stale timer.
           Acts only on a PR quiet for EMPTY_QUIET_MINUTES, so an actively-pushing worker is never raced.
  budget   Close a PR that has been reviewed to the round cap (REVIEW_BUDGET) at its current head and
           is still blocking. CI is the single budget authority — the worker no longer caps itself — so
           a PR is reviewed and fixed until it merges or this closes it. The decision is read from the
           scoreboard ledger (`full_rounds` + per-rubric `states`), so it holds whether or not the
           worker is running. A manual `review-budget-spent` label force-closes a PR early.
  dedup    Close a newer PR that authors the same roadmap target (the `<!--tauceti-target:v1 ...-->`
           body marker) as an older open one. Keep the lowest PR number.
  stale    Close a PR whose latest review scoreboard still has a blocking rubric and which has had no
           activity for STALE_DAYS (default 7): a request for changes nobody acted on, under budget.

The one override is a `keep` label (also `hold`/`wip`/`human`/`do-not-close`): a PR with one of those
is never auto-closed. By design these jobs do NOT spare human-touched PRs — anyone who wants a PR held
adds `keep`. A failed close makes the job exit nonzero.

A scoreboard is trusted only if it carries the `tauceti-scoreboard` marker AND its author is
repo-associated (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR) — the same trust the worker applies. The reviewer and the
PR author are frequently the same account (the worker reviews its own roadmap PRs), so trust is by
association, not by "not the author": an external author cannot forge a repo-associated comment.
